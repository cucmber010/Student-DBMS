# Student-DBMS
Student DBMS in SQL Programming Language for unveristy administration 
This is my first project in SQL Langueage that i will improve further.To be more precise, implement into any application of website.

Here are the business rules:
•	In the DBMS student has its own information (id, first and last name, gender, address, telephone number, email, admission year, GPA)
•	A student has an account in Moodle (the table should consist of account’s ID, login, password and date when was it created)
•	Obviously, a part of students has to pay tuition
•	In the university there are bunch of bachelor programs (IT sphere)
•	Every bachelor program has ID, international code, name and 4 main disciplines
•	About disciplines. Each discipline has its own ID, name, number of credits and professor, respectively
•	Professor conducts only one lesson. In the DBMS it has short personal information 
•	There is one advisors that can control some bachelor programs
•	In addition, professors also have account in the Moodle.
